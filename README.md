ðŸš€ The Next Harvest: A Future Vision
Krishi Rakshak is built to grow. Here's our vision for a smarter agricultural future:
1. IVR System: Bridging the Digital Divide
The Goal: Make our technology accessible to every farmer, even those without smartphones.
The Plan: Launch a toll-free number where farmers can use their keypad to get market prices, weather alerts, and crop advice via voice or SMS. This ensures no one is left behind.
2. AI-Powered Cloud Seeding: Climate-Smart Farming
The Goal: Combat droughts and unpredictable weather on a regional scale.
The Plan: Develop an AI model to analyze real-time meteorological data and identify the perfect conditions for artificial cloud seeding. The app will then alert local authorities, making these climate interventions more effective and data-driven.
