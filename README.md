this is a simulating prototype 
Krishi Rakshak - Your AI Farming CompanionKrishi Rakshak is an all-in-one, AI-powered web application designed to empower Indian farmers with the data, tools, and knowledge needed for modern, sustainable, and profitable agriculture. This prototype, developed for the Smart India Hackathon, serves as a comprehensive digital assistant, bringing advanced technology directly to the fields.âœ¨ Key FeaturesOur prototype is packed with features designed to address the everyday challenges faced by farmers:Advanced Crop Diagnosis: Upload an image of a crop leaf and instantly get a diagnosis of potential diseases with a high confidence score.AI-Powered Deeper Insights (Gemini API): For every diagnosis, farmers can get detailed, easy-to-understand information from a powerful AI, including a list of symptoms, organic home remedies, chemical treatment options, and crucial prevention tips.Personalized AI Crop Plan (Gemini API): Based on the farmer's specific soil type, crop, and location, the app generates a custom 4-week action plan with advice on watering, fertilization, and pest control.Smart Irrigation Control: A digital dashboard allows farmers to monitor soil moisture levels and remotely control their water pumps, with options for both manual and automatic operation.Dynamic Farmer Profile: A personalized dashboard that keeps a dynamic, visual history of all recent crop scans, along with a summary of the farm's soil health and irrigation status.Integrated Marketplace: A one-stop shop for essential agricultural supplies, including pesticides, fertilizers, and safety equipment.Krishi Kendra Locator (Google Maps API): An interactive map that automatically identifies the farmer's location (currently set to Kharar for the demo) and pinpoints the nearest Krishi Kendra (agricultural center).Government Scheme Awareness Board: A scrollable notice board on the main dashboard keeps farmers informed about the latest and most relevant government schemes and agricultural news.ðŸ’» Technology StackThis prototype was built using modern and accessible web technologies, ensuring a responsive experience on both mobile phones and desktop computers.Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScriptAPIs:Google AI (Gemini API): Powers the "Deeper Insights" and "AI Crop Plan" features.Google Maps API: Used for the Krishi Kendra locator.Planned Backend & Database:Firebase/Firestore: For user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.ðŸš€ Future ScopeKrishi Rakshak is designed to be a scalable platform. Here are two high-impact features we plan to integrate in the future to dramatically increase our reach and impact:1. IVR System for Maximum AccessibilityProblem: A significant portion of farmers in India still use feature phones (non-smartphones), creating a digital divide.Solution: We will implement an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. Farmers can call a dedicated toll-free number and access the app's core features using their phone's keypad.How it would work:A farmer dials the Krishi Rakshak number.An automated voice greets them in their local language.The menu would offer options like: "Press 1 for the latest market prices. Press 2 for weather updates. Press 3 for crop advice."The farmer could receive this information as a recorded voice message or as an SMS.For crop diagnosis, they could send an MMS, and the result would be sent back via SMS.This feature ensures that every farmer, regardless of the device they own, can benefit from our technology.2. AI-Driven Artificial Cloud Seeding SuggestionsProblem: Unpredictable monsoons and prolonged droughts are major threats to agriculture in many parts of India.Solution: We plan to integrate an AI model that can analyze weather patterns and suggest optimal conditions for artificial cloud seeding.How it would work:Our platform will continuously analyze real-time meteorological data: atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind patterns, and cloud formation forecasts.The AI model will be trained to identify the most promising atmospheric conditions for successful cloud seeding operations.When a high-probability window is detected in a specific region, the app can send alerts to local government bodies, agricultural departments, and registered farmer co-operatives.This data-driven approach would make cloud seeding efforts more efficient and cost-effective, helping to mitigate the impact of droughts on a regional scale.By turning our app into a hub for this critical data, Krishi Rakshak can play a role in large-scale climate adaptation and water resource management.
